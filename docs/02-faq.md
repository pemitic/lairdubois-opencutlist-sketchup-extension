# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I change the language?

Click the **Preferences** tab on the far bottom right of the maximized OpenCutList window, select the language of your choice. The language of OpenCutList is independent of your SketchUp version, thus in an english SketchUp version you may still select French.

## The dimensions of a component are wrong in the cut list

The dimensions of components are taken from the *bounding box*. Depending on how you draw your component, the bounding box may not be aligned with the component axis. Check out [SketchUp Skill Builder: Group axis and bounding box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UnzHwAt7mc) to learn about relocating the local axis to align the bounding box with your component.

If you disable the option *Automatic orientation of parts*, the generated cut list will respect the *grain direction* of your component.

## I cannot define material in the plugin

On the **Material** tab of OpenCutList, add a new material and configure its type. Alternatively or if you already have material on your components, you may define the material within SketchUp, then it will appear in the **Materials** tab, where you will have to configure additional information. This information will be used to compute raw dimensions (using the oversize) and select the correct thickness if the material is of type **Solid Wood**.

## Why is my material not configured?

If you have just applied material defined in SketchUp, the plugin lacks the additional information it needs to exactly compute the cut list. Check out the tab **Materials** to enter this information for all material used in your model.

## The available thickness/size does not correspond to my material

It is not possible to make an exhaustive list of all thicknesses, sizes and personal preferences. For each material we have listed *default* sizes, which you have to adapt to your local market availability. There is one set for metric units in mm and one for imperial (fractional) units in inches listing a limited set of parameters. You can save your customization and restore it at any time. You can also revert to the original defaults.

## How do I define the grain direction?

On material of type **Solid Wood**, it is assumed that the grain direction runs along the length.

On material of type **Sheet Good**, there may be no grain direction (like for mdf sheets) or a grain direction along the length of the sheet. Some material do have the grain running across the sheet (some birch plywoods), therefore you will have to define the length as being the smaller size.

## I have a ~ (tilde) in front of some of the dimensions

This happens when the dimensions are not exact with respect to the precision of your model. See the menu `Tools -> Model Info -> Units`. Enable the *length snapping* and configure it to the same value as *precision* to minimize the effect. However there are situations where this will almost always happen (because you cut a curve or a bevel or because you changed the units of your model after creating your components).

## How do I add texture to the OpenCutList material?

OpenCutList material **is** SketchUp material with some attributes attached to it. Textures cannot be added directly from OpenCutList to the material, but you can edit material directly in SketchUp if you want to customize its appearance.

## I applied material to my component, but I want some faces to have different materials

OpenCutList selects the top level material of the component to assign the part to a group. You may define other materials to the faces of the component. If you do this on all faces of the part, the color of the component material will not be visible anymore.

## I applied material to all the faces of my component, OpenCutList still says *No Material defined*

Material must be applied to the component, assigning it to all faces is cumbersome and unnecessary.

## My panel parts are displayed in different groups, even though they all have the same thickness

This may happen when your drawing is not *super* precise. Increase the displayed precision in the model info to the maximum, menu `Tools -> Model Info -> Units`. You should now see that not all parts have the same thickness.
If you use fractional inches a ~ (tilde) is displayed in front of the thickness, switch to decimal inches to better see the difference.

## North America only Problems

In North America, there is a distinction between the **nominal** and the **actual** size of many wood products (rough wood, dimensional lumber, wood panels).
SketchUp and OpenCutList work with **actual dimensions**, therefore you need to enter actual sizes and not nominal sizes.

### My model unit is fractional, do I need to enter nominal or actual dimensions?

For dimensional lumber (softwood), when the nominal size is 2 x 4, the actual size will be at least 1-1/2 x 3-1/2 at 19 % maximum-moisture content.

Here are a few examples from [Archtoolbox](https://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/wood-plastic-composites/dimensional-lumber-sizes-nominal-vs-actual.html).

| Nominal Size (inches)  | Actual Size (inches) | Actual Size (mm)|
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
|     1 x 2              |     3/4 x 1 1/2      |      19 x 38    |
|     1 x 4              |     3/4 x 3 1/2      |      19 x 89    |
|     2 x 4              |     1 1/2 x 3 1/2    |      38 x 89    |
|     2 x 8              |     1 1/2 x 7 1/4    |      38 x 184   |
|     4 x 4              |     3 1/2 x 3 1/2    |      89 x 89    |
|     4 x 8              |     3 1/2 x 7 1/4    |      89 x 184   |

### My model unit is fractional, do I need to enter nominal or actual dimensions for my panel?

When you plan to use a panel (OSB, plywood, ...), make sure you note the correct dimensions. Often the hardware store will list the panel with an indication like this:

  Birch Plywood **(Common: 3/4 in. x 2 ft. x 4 ft.; Actual: 0.728 in. x 23.75 in. x 47.75 in.)**

This means that instead of 0.75 in. the panel's thickness is only 0.728 in., not much difference, but 2 ft. x 4 ft. is missing 1/4 in. You need to take this into account when setting up the trimming size for the panel.

### The volume of solid wood is labeled **FBM**, what does that mean?

Rough wood volumes are usually measured in FBM (for "foot, board measure"). One board foot equals 1 ft x 1 ft x 1 in or 12 in x 12 in x 1 in. A measure in FBM is 12 times larger than the volume in ftÂ³. See also the [National Hardwood Lumber Association Grading Rules](https://www.nhla.com/nhla-services/hardwood-industry-rules/).

### Is 4 ft. x 8 ft. the same as 8 ft. x 4 ft.?

It depends! In OpenCutList, the larger dimension or the dimension of the grain direction is the **length** of the panel, the other being the width. If your material has no grain (like mdf) it probably does not matter. For material like baltic birch plywood, the grain may run along the largest dimension or across the board.
